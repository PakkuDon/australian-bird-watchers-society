# Australian Bird Watchers' Society

[Live demo](https://pakkudon.github.io/australian-bird-watchers-society/)

A site for a fictitious government agency for bird watchers to report and track sightings of various bird species across Australia.

## Tools used
- HTML
- Sass
- JavaScript (ES2016)
- ~~React.js FOR NO REASON~~
- Webpack
- Autoprefixer via PostCSS plugin

## Installation and usage instructions
```
npm install
npm run build
# or use npm run dev for live-reloading
Start local server in project root
Open index.html in browser
```

## Approach taken
- Ideation
- Write project tasks and user stories
- Draw wireframes
- Build site
- CSS written with a mobile-first approach in mind

## Difficulties faced
- Decided to go for a Vanilla JS implementation - rolled out my own modal and
multi-step wizard components
- Trying to manage different layouts across media queries when using a checkbox
hack for a dropdown is hard
- Vertically centering things is hard
- CSS is hard
- Design is hard
- Writing content that makes sense is hard
- Writing anything while sleep-deprived is hard

## Future updates
- Add auto-complete textfield containing names for various bird species
- Add back end to track bird sightings
- Add filterable heatmap for bird sightings
- Allow user to select bird sighting from a map
- Improve UX
- Improve mobile experience

## Why?
I've always wanted an excuse to have a website filled with bird pics
